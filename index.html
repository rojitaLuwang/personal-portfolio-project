                        My name is Rojita and I am a computer science engineering graduate.
                        I am trying to get back to the work I love after taking a break
                         in my career due to family commitments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did voluntary services related to technology. The main aim was to provide 
                        help and support people on how to use different gadgets or apps
                         and also dealing with any queries that they have related to technology.
                         It feels good to be able to help in every little way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most of my time is taken up by my two boys. Apart from that I love to spend time gardening.
                         Its always a pleasure to see the flowers bloom in spring time.
                    </p>
